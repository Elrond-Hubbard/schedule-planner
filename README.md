# schedule-planner

[This Schedule Planner](https://elrond-hubbard.github.io/schedule-planner/) allows the  
user to save important reminders in time blocks on the page. Each time block is  
color-coded based on the time of day. The application uses Day.js to generate an  
accurate clock for the user.
